Description: A collection of functions for conducting meta-analysis using a
             structural equation modeling (SEM) approach via the 'OpenMx' and
             'lavaan' packages. It also implements various procedures to
			 perform meta-analytic structural equation modeling on the
             correlation and covariance matrices,
