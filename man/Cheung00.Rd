\title{Fifty Studies of Correlation Matrices used in Cheung and Chan (2000)}
\description{
This data set includes fifty studies of correlation matrices on the theory
of planned theory reported by Cheung and Chan (2000).
}
\usage{data(Cheung00)}

\details{
A list of data with the following structure:
\describe{
  \item{data}{A list of 50 studies of correlation matrices. The
	variables are the attitude toward behavior \emph{att}, subjective norm \emph{sn},
	behavioral intention \emph{bi}, and behavior \emph{beh}}
  \item{n}{A vector of sample sizes}

\note{These studies were extracted from the original data set for
  illustration purpose. Some samples contained two or more correlation
  matrices, and only one of them was arbitrarily selected to avoid the
  problem of dependence. Moreover, studies with less than 3 correlation
  coefficients were also excluded.
